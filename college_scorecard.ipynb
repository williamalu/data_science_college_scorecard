But, are higher tuition costs possibly justified because they're correlated with higher post-graduate earnings? How is the admissions rate of a college related to graduates' earning potential? Are more selective colleges more expensive? To answer these questions, we turn to the US Department of Education's College Scorecard Data.\n",

Some colleges do close, as evidenced by the 90 institution difference between the 2012-13 and 2014-15 dataset. Considering the fact that the College Scorecard contains data for every institution of higher learning in the United States, the yearly churn in institutions shows. That churn, however, definitely does not add up to 1174 institutions, and the way the data is coded in the Scorecard is partially to blame. We match institutions from the 2014-15 dataset to institutions in the 2012-13 dataset using each institution's unique UNITID number. However, from year to year, some institutions' ID numbers change and they get dropped from the dataset. Attempting to compare OPEID or OPEID6 values is a challenge due to the possibility that different institutions may have the same OPEID or OPEID6.\n",
